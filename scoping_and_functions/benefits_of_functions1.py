# NOTES:
# Aside from the ability to reuse code over and over again, functions allow us to build layers of abstraction. One of the perks is 
# that we only need to update our code in one place and those changes will be propagated throughout a more extensive system. We can 
# use functions to abstract some tasks into functions, meaning when we wish to change something, we can change it one place 
# (the function definition), instead of everytime we use that piece of code. An example of this would be, in Python 2, they used a 
# print keyword instead of a print function, and the raw_input function instead of the input function. Letâ€™s have a look at what this 
# would have looked like:
