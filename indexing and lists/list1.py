# notes:
# Here weâ€™ve just created a list called fruits. It is a list of strings separated by commas (,). 
# This comma-separated list of strings is enclosed in a pair of square brackets. At the beginning of the for loop cycle, 
# the for loop will grab the next element (in this case fruit) in the list and will then print it out. Once that cycle is complete, 
# or there are no more statements inside the for loop, the next iteration begins and the next fruit is pulled from the list of fruits.
