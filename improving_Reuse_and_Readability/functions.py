# output:
#     Hello World!
    
    
# Notes:
# In the example, we have created a function definition. This defines what the function will do. The code that we use 
# to define a function is as follows:

# def: This is the keyword that we use to tell Python that we are creating a function definition.
# print_message: This is the name that we’ve decided to give our function. Be sure to give your functions meaningful names so that 
# when other people try to use your code, they’ll able to make sense of what the function does without having to read the code in the 
# function.
# (): The parentheses denote the parameters that a function takes. In this example, we don’t have any parameters yet, but we’ll start
# adding some in soon.

# After all of this, we have the code inside of our function. The code inside the function is the actual logic that we wish to perform.
# In this instance, we just print out Hello World. Lastly, on line 4 we invoke that function which works in the same way that we used 
# print(), only this time we don’t have arguments to pass as the function doesn’t take any parameters. Remove the code from line 4 
# and rerun the code to see what happens. Nothing, right? That’s because just defining the function. 
# The function doesn’t do anything until we invoke or call it.
